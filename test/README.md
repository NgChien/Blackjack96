Unit Tests
==========

There should be more. Time was short on this project, and I felt having the user
tests, where users were simulated was more important for finding bugs. Still, if
I had more time, I would make additional unit tests around the following areas:

* player object
* table object
* card evaluation functions

To run these tests, do the following:

* cd to the root of the project, where the package.json resides
* run `npm test`
